# Create a list of 5 random numbers. How do you access the first and last element of the list?



# Add an element to the end of a list and remove an element from the list.
# Check if the number 7 is present in the list. If it is, print its index.
# Reverse the order of elements in the list without using the built-in reverse() function.
# Sort the list in ascending and descending order.
# List Operations:
# Write a program to count the number of even and odd numbers in a list.
# Find the largest and smallest number in a list.
# How do you remove duplicates from a list?
# Write a Python program that combines two lists and removes duplicate values.
# Given a list of strings, create a new list containing only strings that start with the letter 'a'.
# List Comprehensions:
# Create a list of squares of all numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.
# Given a list of numbers, create a new list with only the even numbers using list comprehension.
# Using list comprehension, generate a list of the first 10 multiples of 3.
# Write a list comprehension that creates a new list from an existing list, converting all negative numbers to their absolute values.
# List and Functions:
# Write a function that takes a list as input and returns the sum of all elements in the list.
# Write a function that returns the second largest element in a list.
# Create a function that checks if a list is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
# Write a function that returns the index of the minimum element in a list.
# Write a function that removes all instances of a given value from a list.
# Advanced List Manipulation:
# Given a list of integers, rotate the list to the right by n positions.
# How do you flatten a list of lists (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4])?
# Write a program that counts the frequency of each element in a list.
# Given two lists of numbers, find the common elements between them.
# Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and its square, for all numbers from 1 to 5.
# Problem-Solving with Lists:
# Given a list of grades, write a program that calculates the average grade and prints the grades above the average.
# Write a program that finds all pairs of numbers in a list that add up to a target sum.
# Given a list of words, write a program that returns a new list with the lengths of each word.
# Write a Python program that splits a list into two sublists, one containing all the positive numbers and the other containing all the negative numbers.
# Write a program that takes a list and returns a new list with only the unique elements, keeping the original order.
# Given a list of integers, find all the triplets whose sum equals zero.
